### Description
The goodreads yearly [book](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11621-2020-reading-challenge) challenge requires you to enter the number of books you want to read for the year. It creates a list of books you
read for the year and tells you how many books remaining until you reach your goal. I created a simple program 
to have another place where I can store the books I've read this year, I enter my books into an ArrayList that outputs to a .txt file. It also tells me how many books I have remaining to reach my goal of 30 books to read for 2020.
